# LAMBS RPG 
This mod is a config level tweak to the vanilla RPG7 and SPG9 vehicle mounted recoilless cannon. 

**RPG7** weapon and ammunition configs are tweaked to allow the AI to target air vehicles and ground infantry. It increases ai dispersion and adds a more powerful cosmetic effect to shooting. 

**SPG9 HEAT** ammunition is tweaked to allow shots against infantry.
