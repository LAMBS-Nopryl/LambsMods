I know some people have been confused about how these medical changes work mechanically, despite playing with it and it being explained
a few times.

Is it possible we can get a readme explanation of the changes to also provide on the forum?

Some took to the changes quickly when it directly effects them in their role but for others some have had little reason to engage with them.

It doesnt have to be huge, just a bullet to explain a main change, and its intended effect.
